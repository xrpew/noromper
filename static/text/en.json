    "description": "El Pasaje is a specialty coffee shop dedicated to music and book enthusiasts. Our mission is to promote and enhance the cultural universe of Vi√±a through intimate concerts and literary mediation activities. <br> <br> Inside, you can find more than 1,200 carefully selected books for you to read while enjoying your coffee or waiting for your food. Consumption is not a requirement; anyone who wants to come and read is welcome to do so without needing to make a purchase. We want the community to enjoy our special book catalog. <br> <br> Our cuisine is artisanal, homemade, and inspired by Argentine flavors. <br> <br> Additionally, we gather every month to discover artists and songs that allow us to escape the noise of the city in an event we call 'Sesiones Pasajeras' (Transient Sessions). <br> <br> All our activities are recorded and uploaded so that everyone can enjoy them on our <b><a target='_blank' style='color: #111111;' href='https://www.youtube.com/@sesionespasajeras'>YouTube</a></b> channel.",
